    <!-- First problem -->
    <h2>1. A time when I was blocked on a simple problem</h2>
    <ul>

      <li>
        <strong>The problem: </strong>I was trying to style my blogs. There was a thin white space around the edge of the page. I just couldn’t get rid of it. I wanted my colour to fill up to the edge of the screen.
      </li>
      <li>
       <strong>The problem-solving techniques that I used: </strong>First I tried some simple solutions that came to mind, like making sure that the width of the content is 100% of the page, extending the edge of the content over the limit to make sure it covers everything. These solutions either did nothing, or solved my problem but introduced new ones. Then I googled the problem because I believed it was quite common. I tried different suggested solutions that I thought were correct until I found the one.
      </li>
      <li>
       <strong>How I felt throughout the process: </strong>I felt a bit frustrated at the start. But it got progressively better when I came closer to finding the right answer. In the end, I was quite happy when the page finally looked like what I wanted.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>What I learned: </strong>I learned that if my problem is not too specific for my project, chances are many people experienced the same thing. So instead of spending too much time solving it myself, I should ask around. Maybe the solution is more simple than I thought.
      </li>
    </ul>

      <!-- Second problem -->
      <h2>2. A time when I elegantly solved a problem</h2>
      <ul>

      <li>
        <strong>The problem: </strong>
        It was a task I did at work where I wrote some SQL. A much simpler analogy for that problem would be checking if today is a weekend. Instead of checking if today is Sunday, then if today is Saturday, I just checked if today day starts with “S”, if yes, it’s a weekend, if no, it’s a weekday
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>The problem-solving techniques that I used: </strong>
        I wrote some pseudocode, then started to write the code. After realising that the final version could be quite lengthy, I reflected on it for a bit. I felt like the method I was going for could be improved to make the code much cleaner. I looked at the data to find if there was any useful pattern that I could exploy.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>How I felt throughout the process: </strong>
        I was very excited about the possibility that I can find a shortcut to the problem. When I finally found it, I felt a unique kind of satisfaction that only problem solving can give me.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>What I learned: </strong>
        I learned that spending some time on planning before starting the actual work is extremely helpful.
      </li>
    </ul>

  <!-- Reflections -->
  <h2>3. My reflect on how confident I feel using each of the below problem-solving techniques/processes</h2>
   <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Googling: </strong>
      I use this method the most. I usually spend a few minutes trying to figure it out by myself. If that doesn’t work, I’d just google it. I find the solution around 90% of the time.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Pseudocode: </strong>
      I absolutely endorse the use of pseudocode. It’s like sketching the structure of a drawing before adding details. It’s simple but effective. It outlines a plan that keeps my line of thought moving in the right direction. It’s also flexible since I can just change it when needed. However, I do need to remind myself to write them down as the excitement of an idea may make me jump to the actual code before doing the planning.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Trying something: </strong>
      I do this a lot as well. When the solution of a problem is not so clear, I may try to solve a similar but easier problem. For example, I tried to write a programme that solves sudokus once. The 9x9 seems so overwhelming so I tried to write one that solved a 2x2 sudokus first. I thoroughly enjoy the process. That’s because instead of stucking in one place and feeling overwhelmed, trying things out help me move forward little by little and discover new ideas along the way. On the smaller scale, like a function, if I don’t see a clear solution, I’ll just write something that may work, then go from there.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Reading error messages: </strong>
      If a bug gives me an error message, more often than not I can find the solution from reading the message. Most of these messages are specific and point directly to the bug. For more complex messages or the ones that involve things that I don’t know, I chuck them in google or ask others.

    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Console.logging: </strong>
      I do this all the time. I usually find my code full of console.log lines. I find it super helpful to make sure a part of the problem works correctly before moving on to the next. For example, when writing a function that searches for an element in an array then modifies it, we may want to check if it identifies the correct element first. The easiest way is to log the result of the first code blog to the console. Console.log also goes hand in hand with “trying something”, because the simplest way to know if “something” works, is to log the outcome out.

    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Rubber ducky method: </strong>
      I haven’t done this much before. But I did try to explain my codes to my colleagues and realised some issues that I didn’t notice. I see a great value in verbally explaining things. Sometimes there are things that make perfect sense in our mind until we say it out loud. I also think this would help us write better comments which is extremely important.

    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Asking your peers for help: </strong>
      If I can’t find the solution from google, I’ll ask my peer for help since they understand the specific case of the problem that I’m talking about. Sometimes their heads are just in a different space at the time, so they are able to see the problem from a different perspective. Also, people are always supportive and happy to help. I ask for help a lot at work too. Since googling may sometimes take a long time. 
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Asking coaches for help: </strong>
      This is my first formal training so I haven’t got experience working with a coach. However, thinking about the kind of questions I may ask, I’d love coaching on a higher level in the problem solving process, such as how to approach the problem, what kind of common techniques people use in similar situations, etc. I may also ask for their advice to make my code cleaner and more efficient.I don’t want to waste their time helping me debug my codes unless I’m absolutely stuck.

    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Improving your process with reflection: </strong>
      There are times that I knew I could do better, and thought about how I’d do it differently next time. Usually I’d quickly write something small that applied the better ideas I had. Also because I am at my learning state, most of my projects are small and experimental, so I can easily apply what I think I should have done in a  new project.
