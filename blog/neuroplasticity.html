    <h2>Neuroplasticity</h2>
    <p>
      Neuroplasticity – or brain plasticity – is the ability of the brain to modify its connections or re-wire itself. Without this ability, any brain, not just the human brain, would be unable to develop from infancy through to adulthood or recover from brain injury.
    </p>
    <p>
      The basic structure of the brain is established before birth by your genes. But its continued development relies heavily on a process called developmental plasticity, where developmental processes change neurons and synaptic connections. In the immature brain this includes making or losing synapses, the migration of neurons through the developing brain or by the rerouting and sprouting of neurons.
    </p>
    <p>
      This concept came quite naturally to me as a former psychology student. Although I didn’t have a term for it, throughout my study, it became apparent that the brain is constantly changing. Especially in the learning process, a new difficult task can become second nature after consistent practice. This happens because during each practice, new synaptic connections are formed, and existing ones are strengthened. Correspondingly, we need to lose or weaken these connections when we want to unlearn something, like a bad habit. It’s important to note that sometimes unlearning something may take more than simply doing nothing. Addiction is an example of very strong synaptic connections that required proactive effort to breaks. For this course in particular, I need to learn to think like a programmer. I also need to unlearn a lot of unproductive routines that I developed over the years. 
    </p>
    <p>
      I believe that this is not only true for concrete skills. Personality traits can also be altered over time. We can learn to be more positive, disciplined or charismatic by spending more time with people who exhibit these traits and actively working on ourselves. How that happens may not be that different from learning to drive a car, where a new demanding task becomes effortless after repeated practice. For example, my confidence in handling social and interpersonal relationships has grown a lot since highschool. Back then, my sole focus was studying, so I spent minimal time doing activities and mingling with others. I came across as extremely shy and passive when interacting with other people. Before saying something or responding to someone, I had many things to consider - Would it be rude if I said this? Is my thought relevant to the current conversation? How should I word this to make it easy to understand? Ect. So most of the time, I kept silent just to be safe, or people changed topics before I could say anything. Now, I believe the same processes still happen in my head. But because I’ve been spending a lot more time with other people (i.e. practicing), it becomes more intuitive to be able to say the right thing at the right time, and keep the conversation flowing. In personality terms, I have become more sociable and outgoing than my past self.

    <h2>Growth mindset</h2>
    <p>
      As discussed above, neuroplasticity suggested that skill and talents can grow overtime. However, whether we believe this fact about ourselves is a different story in of itself. 
    </p>
    <p>
      In simple terms, an individual has a growth mindset if they believe that their talents and intelligence can grow over time through hard work, as opposed to being something innate and fixed. On the other hand, individuals, who believe that their intelligence and talents are predetermined and unchanged, have a fixed mindset. These people think if they’re bad at something, they’ll never be good at it because it’s just not their forte.
    </p>
    <p>
      Researchers have come to the consensus that a growth mindset is critical to success in learning and mastering any skill. This is because a growth mindset encourages people to embrace the challenges, learn from their failure and not to give up easily. This idea is quite intuitive if you think about it. Learning a skill requires a lot of practice which is the process of repeatedly doing something, failing then doing it again a bit differently. So if we thought our talent was fixed, why bother practicing because the result would be the same.
    </p>
    <p>
      Also, some studies suggested that there is a feedback loop between growth mindset and performance. A growth mindset leads to more practicing which results in better performance. A good performance in turn reinforces a growth mindset. The opposite feedback loop is true for the fixed mindset.
    </p>
    <p>
      For me personally, it was a learning journey to move toward a growth mindset. I went to schools in a rural area where science is a very foreign word. It was thought to be for the gifted ones. Also, not surprisingly, the STEM fields were considered to be more suitable for boys who were born being better at these things. Despite not buying these beliefs, I can’t say that they didn’t influence me. I chose to study commerce in spite of my interest in science, because I felt it would be too hard for me. Moving away from my hometown, I was exposed to new ideas and worldviews from people, books and online content. I realized that through dedication and hard work, I can become a master at anything. The first evidence would be my ability to speak a second language, which was really tough to learn but I did it.
