    <h1>My learning plan</h1>
  </div>
  <div class="content">

    <h2>Long term goal</h2>
    <p>
      My long term goal is to become a game developer. I love programming in general, so this may change if I find
      something else I prefer. There are some youtube videos on web games that I planned to watch.
    </p>
    <h2>Strengths and limitations</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        My strength is I learn quite fast if I'm interested in the topic. When that happens, I can give up all
        distraction and focus on
        learning that thing.
      </li>
      <li>
        My weakness is dependence on motivation. When I try to learn something useful but not interested, I have a
        hard time starting to work on it.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Soft skills I want to learn</h2>
    <p>
      I want to learn to improve my self control and assertiveness. I want to reduce my media consumption, and be able
      to refuse requests and invitations, when there are things I need to finish.
    </p>
    <h2>Time management</h2>
    <p>
      I'll try to finish my assignments on time. I'll free up my weekend to make sure I have time if more work need to
      be done. I'll talk to my tutor if I find it too overwhelming.
    </p>
    <h2>Help seeking</h2>
    <p>
      I'll use discord to ask for help from the group, as well as message my tutor if needed.
    </p>
    <h2>What I expect from the Facilitation team</h2>
    <p>
      I expect to be supported, when I have questions and concerns. For the in-person classes, I hope it's easy to talk
      to someone (eg. a quick chat after class, a short catchup, etc.)
    </p>
    <h2>Other schedule</h2>
    <p>
      I'm working full-time until the start of the bootcamp due to my financial circumstance. I have no other commitment
      after that.
