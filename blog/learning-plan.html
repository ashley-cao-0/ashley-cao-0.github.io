    <h1>My learning plan</h1>
  </div>

  <div class="content">
    <h2 class="center">Bootcamp learning plan</h2>
    <h3>Long term goal</h3>
    <p>
      I want to become a full stack or back end senior developer. Through doing the coding exercise, I realised that I’m
      working well with logical problems. I want to focus on growing this skill by tackling more challenging programming
      problems. After leaving Dev academy, I want to work on projects that improve life quality and/or speed up people’s
      working process. I have been in teams where a lot more good would have been done if we had a better system.
      Ideally, but not absolutely necessary, I would love to contribute to renewable energy projects or our zero carbon
      emission mission. I haven’t got a destination in mind yet. There are probably a lot of good companies out there
      that I haven’t heard of. One thing I know is that I want to work in the private sector at least for the beginning.
      I still love making games, but it can be a hobby that I do on the side.
    </p>
    <h3>Strengths and limitations</h3>
    <p>
      Previously I outlined the more general strengths and limitations. They mostly remain unchanged, however,
      throughout the exercises, I discover new ones that are more specific to programming.
    </p>
    <p>
      A new strength I found was my constant search for improvement and useful patterns. I can detect a hint that my
      original idea can be executed in a better way. I can also think of good search terms for the idea to find its
      application online. Finding and successfully applying an idea is my favourite feeling when doing coding.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having ideas is great but it can potentially create problems for me. Despite consciously trying to plan and write
      more pseudo codes, I usually found myself skipping this step when I thought of something new. I just wrote the new
      code in my in-progress work. Also, sometimes new ideas come faster than my ability to execute them, so the
      projects remain unfinished for a while.
    </p>
    <h3>What do I think my biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be</h3>
    <p>
      The first thing I may struggle with is fitting in and getting involved with others in activities and group
      projects. This is because this is new to me since most of my career, I mostly worked independently with occasional
      group projects.
    </p>
    <p>
      Also related to this, interpersonal interactions may be quite challenging for me as well. One of my goals is to
      make new connections, but I’m not too good at initiating and maintaining conversations with new people. For the
      group project, this is even more challenging because we’ll need to maintain the balance between the professional
      side of getting the work done and the personal side of human to human relationships.
    </p>
    <h3>Non-technical skills - human skills - I would like to see developed</h3>
    <p>
      Besides the skills mentioned in the Foundation plan, there are some new non-technical skills that I want to learn
      from the bootcamp.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        First, I want to learn more about teamwork. I worked with other people with an open process where we just figure
        out the plan as we go. I’m curious what a more systematic process would be to collaborate effectively as a team.
        Besides, I want to learn how to build a good relationship with my team members.
      </li>
      <li>
        Second, I can really use some help on my public speaking skill. Doing presentations was always my nightmare in
        university. However, presenting the plan, working progress and prototype is essential in the industry. That’s
        why
        I’d love to practice more on this in the bootcamp.
      </li>
      <li>
        Third, I would love to improve my communication skills. The listening exercise definitely helped me think more
        about my listening and speaking style. I would love to be able to express my feelings and ideas well in the real
        world context where important decisions may entail from my conversations with others.
      </li>
      <li>
        Finally, I want to improve my mindfulness. I practice meditation but find it really hard. I would love to learn
        new tips and tricks that may make this process a bit easier.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>My expectations from the Bootcamp team</h3>
    <p>
      I expect to be able to talk to someone when I need help. I expect to feel safe to share the challenge I’m facing
      and get constructive advice and support.
    </p>
    <h3>My expectations of myself on Bootcamp</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>Help seeking: </strong> for non-technical concerns, I will talk to my Human Skills facilitator in our
      weekly one-on-one catch up. If there are urgent needs, I will send an email or message to the appropriate contact
      person. For technical questions, I’ll talk to my teacher on discord for quick questions, or in-person for more
      complicated questions.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>My plan to manage the workload: </strong>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        I plan to stay on campus as long as I can, so that I can keep my
        head in the study zone, and free from distraction. From my experience in the university, I got a lot more work
        done on campus.
      </li>
      <li>
        I will also create my own checklist for tasks that need to be done. I will try to find myself some study buddies
        so we can encourage each other to study harder. Surrounding myself with positive influence is the best way to
        stay
        motivated. They can also give me tips and tricks on how to manage the workload better.
      </li>
      <li>
        I will also keep in touch with my facilitator on where I am at, so they can give me advice and what to change if
        I
        need.
      </li>
    </ul>

  <div class="content">
    <h2 class="center">Foundation learning plan</h2>
    <h3>Long term goal</h3>
    <p>
      My long term goal is to become a game developer. I love programming in general, so this may change if I find
      something else I prefer. There are some youtube videos on web games that I planned to watch.
    </p>
    <h3>Strengths and limitations</h3>
    <p>
      One of my strengths is that I love to learn new things. In another word, I have intrinsic motivation to learn. I
      am driven to constantly explore different ways to get things done. I work in Education for most of my career. My
      jobs involved a certain set of tasks. It would be just fine if I just stuck to the given responsibility.
      However, we were always under-staffed, and there I saw that there was a lot of potential to improve our
      workflow. Having the support of my managers, I went around and explored the softwares and features that were
      unused by my team. The result was me starting to learn coding and my team having new tools and workflows that
      help them work more efficiently. Another useful asset of mine, especially for programming, is my fascination for
      problem solving. I love logical riddles and mechanical puzzles. Writing and debugging codes is another kind of
      puzzle for me. This might be the reason why the moment I wrote my first line of codes, it all just clicked. I
      knew that my career cannot be anything else but programming.
    </p>
    <p>
      My biggest weakness is discipline. This is amplified during my current job since there is nothing new to learn,
      and the tasks (although may take a long time) are quite easy and require minimal thinking and decision making.
      This is one of the reasons why I want to switch to a more demanding space. I was doing fine during university,
      because of the pressure and the new environment. I moved to a different country to study, so everything was new
      and exciting. I gradually lost all of that after joining the workforce. I believe that the tech industry will
      help me become active again in my learning journey, as new techs are coming out every minute. With that said, I
      am aware that, just like muscles, my habits and mindset take time to change back to their previous state and
      beyond.
    </p>
    <h3>Soft skills I want to learn</h3>
    <p>
      Related to discipline, I want to learn to improve my self-control and assertiveness. For self control, the first
      step would be reducing my media consumption. I was sunken into a bad habit of consuming too much entertainment.
      Also, I made some new friends recently, which is amazing. However, it created problems for my self-learning. I
      struggled to balance my social life and other commitments, like when I tried to develop my drawing skill.
      Sometimes even if I wanted to say no, I could not do it the moment they asked. I did some research and
      assertiveness can be improved. I would love to learn to refuse requests and invitations, when there are things I
      need to finish.
    </p>
    <p>
      Also, I want to learn to be more organised. Most of my learning and working experience are quite ad hoc. There was
      rarely a plan (except for required papers in the university). I learned the programming languages that were
      supported in my workplace. I usually got excited to learn new tech and skills and jumped right in without any long
      term plan. The closest I came to creating and following a plan was when I tried to learn drawing. I identified the
      specific areas I wanted to improve, a list of classes that I would take and a plan on what to do with the skills.
      But many things happened and I wanted to focus on programming for now. I’m sure the planning and organising skills
      I learned here would help me in all other fields of learning.
    </p>
    <h3>Time management</h3>
    <p>
      <strong> My plan: </strong> I will start to work on the materials around 7pm after work after having dinner. I
      will have regular
      breaks in between. Weekend nights will be the time to speed run the parts I have not finished. I will make changes
      based on the feedback of my tutor. Most importantly, I have let my friends and family know that I am doing the
      course and need more time to do my assignments. They are all very supportive. However, I am the only one who knows
      what works best for me, in terms of balancing studying and maintaining social connections.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>When things are building up and starting to get to me: </strong> I will commit more time to try to finish
      the requirements. I will move or cancel other plans to prioritise studying.
    </p>
    <h3>Help seeking</h3>
    <p>
      I'll use discord to ask for help from the group, as well as message my tutor if needed.
    </p>
    <h3>What I expect from the Facilitation team</h3>
    <p>
      I expect to be supported, when I have questions and concerns. For the in-person classes, I hope it's easy to talk
      to someone (eg. a quick chat after class, a short catchup, etc.)
    </p>
    <h3>Other schedule</h3>
    <p>
      I'm working full-time until the start of the bootcamp due to my financial circumstance. I have no other commitment
      after that.
