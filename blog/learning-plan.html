    <h1>My learning plan</h1>
  </div>
  <div class="content">

    <h2>Long term goal</h2>
    <p>
      My long term goal is to become a game developer. I love programming in general, so this may change if I find
      something else I prefer. There are some youtube videos on web games that I planned to watch.
    </p>
    <h2>Strengths and limitations</h2>
    <p>
      One of my strengths is that I love to learn new things. In another word, I have intrinsic motivation to learn. I
      am driven to constantly explore different ways to get things done. I work in Education for most of my career. My
      jobs involved a certain set of tasks. It would be just fine if I just stuck to the given responsibility.
      However, we were always under-staffed, and there I saw that there was a lot of potential to improve our
      workflow. Having the support of my managers, I went around and explored the softwares and features that were
      unused by my team. The result was me starting to learn coding and my team having new tools and workflows that
      help them work more efficiently. Another useful asset of mine, especially for programming, is my fascination for
      problem solving. I love logical riddles and mechanical puzzles. Writing and debugging codes is another kind of
      puzzle for me. This might be the reason why the moment I wrote my first line of codes, it all just clicked. I
      knew that my career cannot be anything else but programming.
    </p>
    <p>
      My biggest weakness is discipline. This is amplified during my current job since there is nothing new to learn,
      and the tasks (although may take a long time) are quite easy and require minimal thinking and decision making.
      This is one of the reasons why I want to switch to a more demanding space. I was doing fine during university,
      because of the pressure and the new environment. I moved to a different country to study, so everything was new
      and exciting. I gradually lost all of that after joining the workforce. I believe that the tech industry will
      help me become active again in my learning journey, as new techs are coming out every minute. With that said, I
      am aware that, just like muscles, my habits and mindset take time to change back to their previous state and
      beyond.
    </p>
    <h2>Soft skills I want to learn</h2>
    <p>
      Related to discipline, I want to learn to improve my self-control and assertiveness. For self control, the first
      step would be reducing my media consumption. I was sunken into a bad habit of consuming too much entertainment.
      Also, I made some new friends recently, which is amazing. However, it created problems for my self-learning. I
      struggled to balance my social life and other commitments, like when I tried to develop my drawing skill.
      Sometimes even if I wanted to say no, I could not do it the moment they asked. I did some research and
      assertiveness can be improved. I would love to learn to refuse requests and invitations, when there are things I
      need to finish.
    </p>
    <p>
      Also, I want to learn to be more organised. Most of my learning and working experience are quite ad hoc. There was
      rarely a plan (except for required papers in the university). I learned the programming languages that were
      supported in my workplace. I usually got excited to learn new tech and skills and jumped right in without any long
      term plan. The closest I came to creating and following a plan was when I tried to learn drawing. I identified the
      specific areas I wanted to improve, a list of classes that I would take and a plan on what to do with the skills.
      But many things happened and I wanted to focus on programming for now. Iâ€™m sure the planning and organising skills
      I learned here would help me in all other fields of learning.
    </p>
    <h2>Time management</h2>
    <p>
      <strong> My plan: </strong> I will start to work on the materials around 7pm after work after having dinner. I
      will have regular
      breaks in between. Weekend nights will be the time to speed run the parts I have not finished. I will make changes
      based on the feedback of my tutor. Most importantly, I have let my friends and family know that I am doing the
      course and need more time to do my assignments. They are all very supportive. However, I am the only one who knows
      what works best for me, in terms of balancing studying and maintaining social connections.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>When things are building up and starting to get to me: </strong> I will commit more time to try to finish
      the requirements. I will move or cancel other plans to prioritise studying.
    </p>
    <h2>Help seeking</h2>
    <p>
      I'll use discord to ask for help from the group, as well as message my tutor if needed.
    </p>
    <h2>What I expect from the Facilitation team</h2>
    <p>
      I expect to be supported, when I have questions and concerns. For the in-person classes, I hope it's easy to talk
      to someone (eg. a quick chat after class, a short catchup, etc.)
    </p>
    <h2>Other schedule</h2>
    <p>
      I'm working full-time until the start of the bootcamp due to my financial circumstance. I have no other commitment
      after that.
