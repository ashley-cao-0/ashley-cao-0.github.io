    <h2>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?</h2>
    <p>
      First, from reading about Neuroplasticity and growth mindset, I learned that any skill and attribute can be
      improved and
      changed, even learning itself. Although it didn’t strike me as a surprise, it was a new concept that I had not
      familiarised myself with before. Reading about this encourage me to set a goal to improve one of the skills that I
      haven’t thought of to work on. It’s my communication skill. Even though it has improved a lot since I started to
      study and interacted with more people, I did believe that I was naturally quite bad at talking to other people and
      making myself understood. I’m looking forward to the activities and group project from the bootcamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      Second, I learned that the thinking process in web development is relevant not only in tech jobs but also very
      useful in
      real life. From the practice of thinking about analogies, I realised I could make an analogy between programming
      and any other kind of problem solving, and use the same guideline for it. For example, both making a car and
      building a programme start with understanding the requirements and planning the process. And the testing process
      and coding is similar to building prototypes and putting it in different conditions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, I learned that I’m not particularly good at refactoring codes. I could write something that works, but
      then I wanted to change it a bit to make it more readable and easy to upgrade. That usually leads to disaster
      which makes
      my code from before stop working, and the new layout not making much more sense. I’m keen to learn what is the
      industry standard in terms of structuring the code in the most readable and efficient way.
    </p>
    <h2>What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</h2>
    <p>
      I believe that learning is the most effective when it is self-driven. Therefore, our approach to learning, how we
      interact with the learning materials, our peers or teachers vastly depend on what we value the most, and how we
      see ourselves. However, learning is also a collaborative process. It requires frequent interaction among learners,
      and between learners and teachers. That is why it’s important to understand what others are coming from, what they
      are trying to achieve and how their goal fits with our goal.
    </p>
    <p>
      The same applied for programming in particular. Since it’s a creative process, there are always many ways to
      achieve the same result. The programming style does reflect the programmer’s values. For example, if the
      programmer who values trust over accountability will write different codes compared to the counterpart. Self
      awareness also plays a huge role. Programming is broad with ever expanding information. Knowing our strengths,
      weaknesses is a key in good collaboration. Similarly, understanding others' feelings, why they do what they do is
      super useful in teamwork. For example if a senior team member did not give good guidance, it might not be because
      they did not want to help. They might be too familiar with the subject to know what is easy and what is hard.
    </p>
    <h2>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h2>
    <p>
      It’s how important non-technical skills are. I spent some time researching on becoming a programmer but most of
      the information focuses on technical skill. I haven’t worked in a real programming team before. So, I am not aware
      of how the communication happens when a programme or website is being built. Learning about these different
      concepts gives me a better idea of what other aspects of my learning journey I should focus on. For example,
      reading about Emotional Intelligence helps me know that across all fields, no matter how technical they are,
      require human interaction and collaboration between different parties. And how important understanding others and
      your own feelings can be in achieving our goals. Therefore, one of my goals is to make many new connections in the
      bootcamp. Learning about different people with their unique interests and background can help grow my social
      competency and prepare for new interpersonal interaction.
    </p>
    <h2>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h2>
    <p>
      It is going through the reading materials. I usually have a hard time engaging with the more technical articles.
      Also, while doing more research, some concepts refer to studies and publications that give the most accurate
      description, but are harder to understand. I usually watch some short Youtube videos for a general idea. Some core
      studies included videos which were really helpful.
    </p>
    <h2>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web
      development Bootcamp course?</h2>
    <p>
      I think because you believe that there are other important factors that make a good programmer besides coding
      skill. For example, the ability to deconstruct a problem to a smaller chunk, how readable our code is, our mindset
      on how we can improve, etc. Also, other knowledge such as improving emotional intelligence, adopting a growth
      mindset, etc. could have an indirect but significant effect on the quality of our work during and beyond the
      bootcamp.
    </p>
    <h2>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that
      time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</h2>
    <p>
      No, I did find it useful. If I only code the whole time it could be overwhelming. So I think a balance between
      learning two different skill sets may help improve comprehension and wellbeing. Also as I mentioned earlier,
      teamwork and communication are extremely important across all industries including programming. Therefore learning
      about the concepts behind how these skills can be improved would help me in my journey. In addition, one of the
      articles I read when researching about learning suggested that mixing different skills in learning yields better
      results than focusing on a single one, then moving to the next.
