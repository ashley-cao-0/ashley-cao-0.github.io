    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      JavaScript, HTML and CSS are three main components that make up a webpage. HTML defines the structure and content
      of the page. CSS defines the layout and formatting of the content. JavaScript make the elements interactive.
    </p>
    <p>
      They work together like how we make food. HTML is the necessary ingredients with different hierarchies (main
      ingredients, supplements, seasonings, etc.). CSS is how the dishes are presented. Javascript is the instruction on
      how to make the dish. HTML and CSS alone are like a fruit platter. The ingredients are presented directly on the
      plate with no cooking involved. Fruit platters have their own function but can’t produce diverse and interesting
      results compared
      to cooking and pastry. Similarly, HTML and Javascript alone are like fried rice where you eat directly from the
      pan. It works, just doesn't look so nice.
    </p>
    <h2>Control flow and loops</h2>
    <p>
      Control flow is the order in which the code is executed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Back to the cooking analogy, you can follow a recipe step-by-step. However, sometimes you can do them in different
      order, or skip a number of steps depend on the circumstances. For example, to make
      dumplings you can make everything from scratch, but "if" you have remade ingredients like the skin, you can
      skip that part.
    </p>
    <p>
      Loops are the set of steps that are done repeatedly until a condition is met. Like some recipes may tell you to
      beat the egg until fluffy, or add 5 tablespoons of sugar. Both include doing the same thing over and over again
      for a fixed number of times, or until a condition is satisfied.
    </p>
    <h2>The DOM</h2>
    <p>
      The DOM (Document Object Model) defines the way a document (like HTML) is structured and how it is accessed and
      manipulated. I can interact with it by assigning an id to the elements in HTML, and use Javascript to identify and
      interact with those elements.
    </p>
    <h2>Accessing data from arrays and objects</h2>
    <p>
      We access data from arrays using the indexes of the array elements. It’s like saying “Give me the first dish on
      the
      menu". Whereas we access data from objects using the keys in the key-value pairs. It’s like asking “How much is
      this chicken curry?” (each dish in the menu has a price).
    </p>
    <h2>Functions</h2>
    <p>A function is a set of instructions that is designed to perform a particular task. Functions are useful when we
      need to do that task multiple times but don’t want to list all of the steps again and again. That makes the code
      easier to read. For example, a recipe may just tell you to go fry an egg, instead of listing stuff like heat the
      pan, add oil, etc.</p>
