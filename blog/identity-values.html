    <h2>Ethical decision</h2>
    <p>
      I used to work on the programme that provides free lunches to schools. One time I was handling two very different
      tasks: making a tool for my team using VBA, and processing invoices.
      They were required by two different groups of people. Both tasks were high priority. I didn't have time to do both
      within the deadline. Personally I prefer doing coding. The invoice checking was super repetitive and boring. I
      could
      ask my manager to assign me on the VBA project exclusively. However, if the invoices weren't processed in time,
      some
      schools might not be able to provide lunches to their students. I wanted to do the right thing so I talked to my
      manager and the team that needs the VBA tool that they'd need to wait.

    <h2>How culture and people influence my value and indentity</h2>
    <p>
      Living in a different country has changed my values. In my hometown people focus more on routine like graduating
      to
      getting a job and settling down. Now I spend more time exploring myself and finding new interests. I’ve also
      developed good relationships with my superiora which was harder back home.
    </p>
    <h2>My strengths</h2>
    <p>
      My strengths are curiosity and calmness. I’m motivated to learn new things. This would help me approach new
      knowledge and skills in the course. I do quite well in stressful situations. This may help at the peak time.
    </p>
    <h2>My limitations</h2>
    <p>
      My limitation is time management. I struggled to balance study and other activities. I find it hard to say no to
      friends. This may affect my study but I’m working on it. I’ve cut down my screen time since the course started so
      that’s something. I’m also working on reducing other distractions.
    </p>
    <h2>Group project story</h2>
    <p>
      I used to work on a group project in my university. One of my teammates refused to split the work evenly and tried
      to get the easier part. I asked the others what they thought, and organised a small catch up for the whole team.
      The
      result was he agreed to do the part but failed to send us the work on time. If it happened now, I’d follow up with
      him more often on where he’s at, and talk to the lecturer if needed.
