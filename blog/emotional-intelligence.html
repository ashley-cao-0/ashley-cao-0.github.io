    <h2>What is emotion?</h2>
    <p>
      Emotion is a conscious mental reaction (such as anger or fear) subjectively experienced as feelings usually
      directed toward a specific object and typically accompanied by physiological and behavioral changes in the body.
    </p>
    <p>
      A current psychology theory suggests that emotion exists to serve as a master-programme that regulates our other
      behaviours (the sub-programmes) to produce the optimum outcome. For example, when we’re in fear of danger,
      processes such as hunger, fatigue as well as other mundane thoughts are shut down, while processes that prepare us
      for fight or flight are amplified.
    </p>
    <p>
      Contrary to popular belief that emotion usually leads us astray, emotion is known to be one of the key factors for
      our success as a species. Because resources and time are scarce, emotion helps us make decisions efficiently by
      providing instantaneous responses based on the
      available information in our environment. And those responses, more often than not, leads to
      the right decisions. For example, we usually know very quickly if someone has a potential to become our good
      friend
      (it just clicks) without having to think about it for an extended period of time.
    </p>
    <h2>What is emotional intelligence? How is EQ different from IQ?</h2>
    <p>
      Because emotion is such a big part of who we are, being able to understand and use emotion effectively is a
      crucial skill. This skill is usually referred to as emotional intelligence (also known as EQ).
    </p>
    <p>
      One the other hand, IQ measures our ability to solve problems, use logic, and grasp or communicate complex
      ideas.
    </p>

    <h2>Why is EQ important</h2>
    <p>
      Emotion and reasoning are not in conflict but work together to help us solve problems. Pure logic can solve a
      single math problem. But to carry out plans that require balancing our different interests and resources, or
      involve working with other people, we need both IQ and EQ.
    </p>
    <p>
      Needless to say, humans are complex beings, and most of our problems are also complex. They usually require us to
      understand ourselves, what we can and want to do, as well as what help we need from others and how to get them.
      Therefore, improving both our emotional intelligence and reasoning capacity are essential to one’s success and
      well-being.
