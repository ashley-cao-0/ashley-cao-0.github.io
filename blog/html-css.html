    <h1>The differences between relative, absolute, and fixed positioning</h1>
  </div>
  <div class="content">
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>Position is a CSS property used to define where an element should be on a page. Three main positions are
      relative,
      absolute and fixed.</p>
    <h2>Relative positioning</h2>
    <p>An element with position: relative; is positioned relative to its normal position. Setting the top, right,
      bottom,
      and left properties of a relatively-positioned element will cause it to be adjusted away from its normal position.
      Other content will not be adjusted to fit into any gap left by the element.</p>
    <h2>Fixed positioning</h2>
    <p>An element with position: fixed; is positioned relative to the viewport, which means it always stays in the same
      place even if the page is scrolled. The top, right, bottom, and left properties are used to position the element.
    </p>
    <h2>Absolute positioning</h2>
    <p>An element with position: absolute; is positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor (instead of
      positioned relative to the viewport, like fixed).</p>
    <h2>The differences</h2>
    <p>In general, the fixed positioning is used to keep an element where it is, on the screen, even if the page is
      scrolled. Relative positioning is used to adjust the position of an element relative to the page. And the absolute
      positioning is used to adjust the element relative to its closet parent element.</p>
